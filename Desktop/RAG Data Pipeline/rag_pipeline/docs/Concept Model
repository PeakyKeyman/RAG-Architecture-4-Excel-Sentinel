## High-Level System Architecture

At its core, the system is a sophisticated, multi-path retrieval-augmented generation engine. It's designed not as a simple pipeline, but as an orchestrated set of microservices that are intelligently selected based on user intent.

The architecture is split into three main parts:


The Offline Data Ingestion Pipeline: This is where all knowledge is processed, structured, and stored.

The Online Inference Pipeline: This is the real-time, user-facing part that answers queries.

The Asynchronous Feedback Loop: This is the system that allows for continuous improvement and adaptation over time.

## Component 1: The Offline Data Ingestion Pipeline

This is the foundation of your system's intelligence. Its goal is to take raw, unstructured, or semi-structured client data and transform it into a highly searchable knowledge base.


1. Data Source Connectors:

Function: Securely connect to and pull data from various client sources (e.g., SharePoint, Google Drive, local file uploads, Confluence).

Technology: Use pre-built connectors from libraries like LlamaIndex or build custom API clients. This needs to be robust and handle authentication securely (OAuth2).

2. File Type Router & Parser:

Function: Ingests a file and routes it based on its type (e.g., .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx). Each file type is sent to a specialized parser.

.xlsx files are sent to a Specialized Excel Parser that extracts not only cell text but also tables (as Markdown), VBA macros (as code blocks), and renders charts (as images).

.pdf and .pptx files are sent to a multi-modal parsing service that extracts text, tables, and images.

Technology: Python services using libraries like pypdf, python-docx, and openpyxl.

3. Pre-processing & Chunking Engine:

Function: Takes the parsed content and chunks it into meaningful pieces. This isn't just a fixed-size split; it's a "semantic chunking" engine that tries to split by paragraphs, sections, or slides to preserve context.

Technology: Custom Python logic or advanced chunking methods from libraries like LangChain.

4. Dual Knowledge Base Creation:

Function: This is the critical step where the chunked data is sent to two different systems in parallel.

A. The Vector Database (for Semantic Search):

Each chunk of text, code, or table is sent to an embedding model (e.g., text-embedding-3-large).

The resulting vector embeddings are stored in a Vector DB.

Technology: Pinecone, Weaviate, or Vertex AI Vector Search.

B. The Graph Database (for Relational Facts):

The chunks are also sent to an LLM with a specific prompt to perform Entity and Relationship Extraction.

The LLM identifies nodes (e.g., people, companies, metrics) and edges (e.g., "works_at," "audited_by," "has_revenue").

This structured data is then loaded into a Graph DB.

Technology: Neo4j or Amazon Neptune.

## Component 2: The Online Inference Pipeline

This is the real-time engine that a user interacts with. It's built for low-latency decision-making and high-accuracy responses.


1. API Gateway & Frontend:

Function: The user's query enters the system here. This layer handles user authentication, rate limiting, and request validation.

2. Semantic Caching Layer:

Function: Before any processing, the system checks if a semantically similar query has been answered recently.

It takes the user's query, embeds it, and searches a separate, simple vector cache of past question-answer pairs. If a close match is found, the cached answer is returned instantly.

Technology: Redis with a vector search index, or a managed service like GPTCache.

3. The Query Router:

Function: If no cache hit, the query is sent to the "brain" of the operation. This is a fast, cheap LLM call (e.g., Gemini Flash, GPT-3.5-Turbo).

Its prompt is highly structured to classify the user's intent: is it a graph_query or a semantic_query?

4. Path A: The GraphRAG Path:

Function: Triggered if the router decides graph_query.

4a. NL-to-Graph Query: An LLM translates the user's question into the appropriate graph query language (e.g., Cypher).

4b. Graph DB Execution: The query is run against the Graph DB, returning structured, factual data.

4c. Context Packaging: The clean results are packaged as context.

5. Path B: The Semantic Search Path:

Function: Triggered if the router decides semantic_query.

5a. Ensemble HyDE: The query is sent in parallel to 3-5 different small, fast LLMs to generate hypothetical documents.

5b. Hybrid Search: These hypothetical documents are used as queries to the Vector DB. The search uses both vector similarity and keyword matching to retrieve the top 50 candidate chunks.

5c. Reranker: The top 50 chunks and the original user query are sent to a specialized reranker model (e.g., Cohere Rerank), which re-scores them for relevance and selects the absolute best 3-5 chunks.

5d. Context Packaging: These highly relevant chunks are packaged as context.

6. The Final Generation Layer:

Function: The context from either Path A or Path B is passed to a powerful, state-of-the-art LLM (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o).

This layer uses the Context-Distillation Prompting technique we discussed, first asking the model to identify the relevant facts within the context before synthesizing the final, user-facing answer.

## Component 3: The Asynchronous Feedback Loop

This component ensures the system gets smarter over time. It does not operate in real-time.


1. Logging & Telemetry:

Function: Every step of every query is logged: the router's decision, the retrieved chunks, the user's feedback (thumbs up/down), the final answer, and latency.

Technology: A logging service like Datadog or a custom solution using a data warehouse like BigQuery.

2. Offline Analysis Engine:

Function: A separate process (e.g., a nightly or weekly job) runs over these logs.

It uses statistical analysis to identify "bad chunks" (chunks that are frequently part of negatively-rated answers) or incorrect graph relationships.

3. Knowledge Base Adjustment:

Function: The analysis engine triggers actions.

For the Vector DB, it might send an instruction to down-weight a problematic chunk's vector by adding negative metadata.

For the Graph DB, it might flag a relationship for human review or automatically prune it if confidence is low.
